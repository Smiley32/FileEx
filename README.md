# FileEx

This is an original file explorer (a very alpha version).

My idea was to create an explorer without folders. In fact, the files are still on the drive, but with my explorer, you just have to add the file you want in the software, and then this document can be found by the software.

You can do some research by keyword, and the software will found the files with the wanted keyword. With that, the file can be everywhere on the disk, it doesn't matter.
